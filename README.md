for firmware, settings and sample-data provenance.

## Controls

Wheel selects a rate. OK refreshes. Back exits.

## Settings

Open **Apps → Rates Board → Setup**. Saved settings are read when the app starts.

| Setting | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source URL | string |  |
| Access token | string |  |
| Refresh (sec) | integer | 30 |
| Decimals | integer | 4 |

Source URL supplies rates in the documented JSON format. Values are displayed as supplied by the source.

Access token is sent as a Bearer token. Configure URLs and credentials in the web settings. Remote sources require Wi-Fi.

Failed refreshes retain the last valid data and show an error. Values older than three refresh intervals are marked stale.

See [docs/DATA.md](docs/DATA.md) for the response format and [examples/response.json](examples/response.json) for a sample.
